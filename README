This is the README file of the vchat implementation called VChat23.

This software is licensed to you under the terms of the GNU public
license  See the file COPYING for details.

This is not a released product, but the working prototype of the
chat server and client.

The assumed running environment is a FreeBSD system with perl5
installed.  An early revision of the client has been ported to
Linux.

There are two components in this distribution.  The program
chatserver.pl handles the client messages and dispatches messages to
the clients.  It is written in Perl, and uses a bunch of the newer
features of Perl5.  The client frontend is written in C++ and talks to
the server on port 2323.  It is best used with a terminal which
supports a scrolling region (e.g. VT100).

The chatserver also supports SSL connections through the use of
the sslprox.pl script.  SSL connections can be preauthenticated if
client certs are used.

A new client, written in C and based on curses, is included in the
client-count subdirectory of this distribution.  Please note that this
client is not supported by me but by Count (count@flatline.de).  It
may also have different licensing.

Contact hans@vaxbusters.org if you find major security defiencies and/or
feel like helping.  Please do not flame me for making an unfinished
piece of crap available to the public.

Thanks,
Hans
