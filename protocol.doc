Chat protocol.

The protocol is designed to be useable both by humans and by user
interface programs.

Clients connect to the chat server using a tcp connection.  The
connection is handled in a full-duplex fashion - Both the server and
the client may submit messages at any time.
The chat server prefixes all administrative messages with a
three-digit positive number, a space and the message.  An exception to
this rule are user messages (i.e. text entered from one participant to
one or multiple other receipients).  These are prefixed by the nick
name of the sender, enclosed in brackets ('<' and '>') for public
messages or asterisks ('*') for private messages.

Coded server messages may have parameters.  The parameters follow the
space, and may themselves be followed by comments.  The parameters and
the comments are delimited by a space character.  This makes additions
of parameters to messages impossible.

The following messages are defined for the server:

100 <message...>

Informational message for human consumption

110 <channel> <nick> <fromhost>

Message continuation is supported by replacing the space after the
message code with a dash ('-') in all but the last lines of a message
When a client connection
has been established, the server responds with a signon message.
