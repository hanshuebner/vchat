First compile the stuff.
Set up your environment variables:

CHATHELPERL	=> path to chat.pl (from this directory)
CHATSERVER	=> name:port of chat server (i.e. vchat.vaxbusters.org:2323)
INPUTRC		=> path to inputrc (which should at least contain
		   "set horizontal-scroll-mode on"

'vchat' should be useable now.

Good luck!
